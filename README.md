## Skills
#### Agile Learner
- I have a strong history of agile learning. During my 7 years with Islington Council, I rose from support worker to Deputy Head of Service. This required me to continuously learn new concepts at pace to ensure that services were well supported. I have great desire to succeed and try new things, which led me to Makers Bootcamp, pushing myself to the edge of my comfort zone and drive on my development.  

#### Communication
- I have a proven track record of clear and storng communication. Throughout my working life I regularly gave presentations to both frontline staff and senior management, ensuring that complex ideas were understood fully. I am trained to deliver training in a variety of roles and did so regularly during my employment. 

#### Leadership
- I have spent the past few years working in more senior leadership roles. I feel that my experience of this was shaped by my progression from front line care to senior management.
